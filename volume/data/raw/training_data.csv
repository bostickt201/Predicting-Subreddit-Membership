CFB,Beat Maryland and he s 10 1 for the third time in five full seasons    Yeah the OSU losses suck but god damn it s nice to consistently have meaningful games the final week of the year   EDIT  6 seasons  whoops
Cooking,I honestly have no idea  Here in Italy we have only two kinds   skim  and  whole   I guess that the higher the fat content the better
CFB,yo wtf  The amount of totally out of left field hate my team gets from BigTen schools is insane  especially those in the state of Illinois
cars,Oh wow  that s a very thorough explanation    following your points step by step I think that makes the most sense  that ll be a challenge to implement    Thanks for the walkthrough
CFB,You can be offended whenever you want  but if you look at a team giving 20 in the spread and losing by 23  it really doesn t matter who the winning team was  The fact is that Florida got blown out when they were favored by 20  Unfortunately for Mullen  this isn t the first bad game they ve had  either  They ve already lost 5 games this year  Their remaining games are winnable  but who knows what they ll show in them
cars,Until you feel the need to move on  Sell and get a new one once you feel the need for something different  Could be one month  could be ten years
politics,Tariffs don t enrich anyone except the government from fee payments and end up costing the consumer some choice in products since domestic products almost inevitably raise their prices to match the size of the tariff   Businesses didn t ship jobs overseas to hit the evil button  They did it because they have a duty to their shareholders to maximize profit
CFB,He apparently said postgame that they weren t trying to score  but wanted Minnesota to use their timeout  That makes the playcalling bizarre to me  At that point just kneel
politics,gt  I think they deliver now  You know  because of COVID  I m a few decades in  and it s a rare year that the White House delivers anything
cars,is 10k a good price for a 1982 corvette vehicle with 20 000 miles  This sounded good to me but im not much of a car guy  I saw a while corvette going for  20k  but it had 56k miles on it  Most prices I can find seem to average 16k to 30k   Just curious if older cars are worth 20kish with low milage  I feel like they would be worse in the long run if they might break down and have no parts to repair it since older cars are no longer being manufactured
science,Unlike almost everyone in this thread I don t think much about others at all  so this aligns with my expectations
CFB,The key difference that BYU has is that they don t have any sort of autobid tie in that would allow them to get in  There s a high possibility that a lower ranked team will get in before BYU due to autobids  They ll have to be top 10 to get in  which they probably won t have due to the other teams ahead of them having played P5 conference schedules and Cinci already in position to take the G5 autobid and with undefeated UTSA there as well

StockMarket,Won t the breaking of passwords affect basically any password protected thing not just for blockchains  Also some crypto wallets have mechanisms in place that break when a wrong pass phrase is used 3 times in a row
CFB,Most of the criticism that gets lauded at James is usually fair  Yes  there s a certain faction that goes overboard with it  It s what happens when you have a fan base as large as ours  But there s a lot of people who defend James no matter what  which is fine  and if you even dare criticize him  you get ripped for it and it s assumed that you want him fired  It s weird to me
cars,Oh for sure  I would try to record the sound  Does the Prius have kinetic energy recovery systems on the creaky wheels
cars,Yeah  this is what I was thinking  I ve never heard of a warranty claim covering a customer picking out their own car at a rental place without any sort of agreement  If that was the case  people would be renting Bentley and Ferraris    If there is anything extra that is owed  it will be based on a lemon law claim  But there are pretty set guidelines for that type of thing
magicTCG,He s actually not dead  Gix was last seen falling through a time portal during a battle with Urza  No one knows if he was destroyed or he might reappear at any time
StockMarket,In short    the FED has your back   Been this way since the olden days  2009    You got some catching up to do Rip Van Winkle
politics,baloney  even if we had a multi party parliamentary system there wouldn t be enough voters on the left to do anything on your own  you would still have to work with a more moderate party to get anything done  but too many on the left hold their breath and stomp their feet and stay home and blame apathy instead of tempering their expectations and shooting for good instead of perfect  it s too bad we could get a lot of good done if they would just show up
magicTCG,It feels like this would inevitably creep towards a future where every single card in a set would be focused on the planeswalkers to the near exclusion of all else

science,Same  Does it make you press your cheek into the rest  piece   of a shotgun more  Only asking cause when I went clay pigeon shooting my cheek caught a sweet yellow bruise  Tbf I m a pretty skinny guy so that could be a facial structure thing   Can t actually remember if I used my dominant or non dominant eye  was a few years ago

CFB,Cincinnati but only because I think it would be awesome for Cincinnati to make the playoff   Don t really care who we play
politics,gt   I was totally just kidding when I said that I wanted to take away  lt insert religious group here gt  s freedom of religion    You do know religions aren t allowed to do all sorts of things  so we put limits on what religions can and can t do   Why shouldn t the same apply to gun and gun ownership
RealEstate,That isn t really accurate  Most real estate representation contracts allow for early termination of the agreement
science,Exactly  Therapy is not like medication  where you have no choice but to feel the effects  It requires work that some clients are not willing to do  I suspect this is why the efficacy rate is being reported so low  I ve had a few clients who are one step away from a major breakthrough and get scared so they give up on it  Others won t do things like record thought and behavior patterns outside of session so we can improve them
CFB,gt will never be looking to leave for a bigger better job    that s all rhule does  he s a great coach and he d be a great hire but he s horrible about jumping ship  he went from temple to baylor to the nfl in what four years
CFB,The Oregon v WSU game I think  Oregon going to the CFP is probably the best thing for us so there s some implication
CFB,PFF also gave Dan Mullen their 2020 COTY and rated Spencer Rattler the best overall player going into 2021 so I d pretty much disregard anything they say in regards to CFB
travel,If you are flexible on your dates and avoid traveling on over Dec 24 25 46  you can get Cancun for    300  Cabo for under  400   heck  London is just over  600
CFB,Down voted with no response  It s true though   We struggled with teams like Florida and lost to texas a amp m    Cincinnati is struggling with fucking tulsa   I wish they would get put in so we can watch them get massacred by a real team and maybe this shit will be laid to rest for a few years
politics,Thanks for not answering a straight forward question  The answer was around 18 billion went directly to Afghanistan for the full year of 2020  It was a simple question and you couldnt even answer it
cars,gt    the exact name escapes me right now   The ZG   That was less of a widebody kit and more of some bolt on fender extenders
CFB,I ll agree that I probably don t have full visibility into all the factors that weighed into the decision for Middle Tennessee  Having said that  at least from an outside observer it appears they made a decision that gets them some extra short term cash at the expense of long term stability
MachineLearning,I would definitely not cite someone doing dishonest work  at least not in a way that will increase their citation count  I just ignore papers that I cannot reproduce so that others don t waste their time on it
politics,At first I read that headline as    libertarians   grapple with conservatives      then I caught my mistake and remembered that the so called  libertarians  will be the first ones to toss LGBT books and books about the civil rights movement into the bonfire
CFB,There are half empty and half full people  You are like  Fuck it  the glass probably doesn t have a bottom    Enjoy the ride dude

science,That s how Teva did it  But they re now huge and the regulatory environment has changed  so short of Amazon blitzing the space I don t know how much it would cost to fund a new entrant  If it were less than   200mm  I think it would be doable
travel,And I think the crux here is tipping culture in the US  That s why it matters that tables are rotated between servers
CFB,What about 1st down cameras  I know this could possibly slow down games but for important downs having a camera on the sticks would be huge
RealEstate,You could get the same information from a home inspection  priced in the hundreds  and had legal representation from an attorney  typically less than  2k
RealEstate,gt  been a pretty artificial inflation  you can argue about the cause  but prices ARE up  so calling it artificial is pretty meaningless  It has is already happened happening
CFB,gt It s actively happening  No one is fabricating anything   You literally are lmfao  Talking about 2 loss Bama getting in over other teams before we have even gotten to the SEC championship is fabrication

science,I see  Microdosing can be therapeutic too  just so you know  In my experience it alleviates anxiety and makes me generally content  I m not sure about how long these effects last  though

CFB,A few years ago Jacksonville State who are from Alabama came up to Maine in December for the FCS playoffs  You could tell they wanted nothing to do with the weather and got swiftly blown out
RealEstate,So I want to still go through with the house  The thing I worry about is that the lender does a final approval at close  and they may see that the permits aren t there  and then the loan is canceled  And in that case I d lose the house and my earnest money deposit  As of today  the appraisal went through and the lender has approved the loan  But I m told they always do a final check later at close
travel,Because for some reason  even if there are 100 empty tables  people will choose to sit at the table that hasn t been bussed yet  Lol

RealEstate,Otoh places like alameda county  Berkeley  Oakland  now penalize for sitting on vacant land but simultaneously making it impossible to build  It s a lose lose
CFB,Could be a few things  Not making any excuses because I entirely disagree with the ranking  but possibly  Bad officiating  overturned TD  very bad missed PIs and holding   being on the road  or being outgained by 150 yards
Cooking,Butternut Squash soup  Roasted Brussels Sprouts  Roasted Acorn Squash  for her   Long  slow cooked stews  Turkey soup from leftovers   Nothing better than setting up the slow cooker for a hearty stew beef  potatoes  carrots  etc   while it snows like hell outside
CFB,I feel like Manhattan for the Oklahoma schools is a little weird  but for every Texas school it feels like the moon  It feels even more foreign than Ames for some reason

MachineLearning,Sometimes there s only so much you can get out of your data  but sometimes you just fail to search over enough of the hyperparameter surface using simple methods  Give this a read for starters http   brendanhasz github io  2019 03 28 hyperparameter optimization html   Also  sometimes domain experience and practice can help you establish better starting points and regions to search across
magicTCG,Davriel was yote from Strixhaven too in favor of Liliana  It s getting really tiresome tbh  We have a ton of Liliana and Kaya cards at this point  it really wouldn t kill them to let another lesser used  so not Sorin either lol  black aligned walker have a slot once in a while xD  I m hoping they finally give him a real card in New Capenna

CFB,to be fair ever since we started starting our fourth string true frosh 3 star LT the OL has been playing a ton better and the performances have improved quite a bit  That doesnt mean ND is a great team all of a sudden  just dont think there are that many great teams around this year   Please dont read this as ND should have a route into the playoffs when winning out  dont want any part of UGA  I want a NY6 bowl against a team we can beat and start next year on a high
MachineLearning,but the reviewer who gave reject know every weakness of me  I think he even knows my childhood traumas
CFB,I get that John Chavis was bad for you  but he also orchestrated one of the greatest defenses in college football history  2011 LSU  and was one of the top assistants in the country for decades at UTK and LSU    Taking a part time job in his retirement doesn t mean he s a bad DC

CFB,Tidbit  Last year when Florida decided to shit on not only our team  but also boasted how they were gonna win purely off being an SEC team and we basically had no business winning  we took a massive dump on their lawn    I promise you  a underrated and hated OU team is way more furious than a Baylor team that got beat by TCU  That s not slight against ya ll  I m just saying

cars,My first reaction is Bmw 760i  the only car with a factory option of bulletproof windows and body panels   Although I can t remember if those came awd or not amd it really depends on how hazardous of conditions  But the thought of one of those in like a 6  lift kit is amusing

travel,Iran  It s isn t what the USA makes it out to be  Also Mexico  Americans have such a misguided perspective of their neighbor
CFB,We have a huge cultural problem with people not going to the game  Our tailgate is called  the boulevard   and is genuinely one of the best tailgates in all CFB IMO  it s modeled after The Grove since our President is Ole Miss  old chancellor   so for most people it s more fun to continue boulevarding with free food and drink than to go into the game   We have better attendance at night games because they don t have the option to keep drinking outside the stadium
Cooking,Well if you want to have a little fun anything blue raspberry  If you want to be fancy and spend some money blue crab
CFB,Right the thing is  I am so tired of hearing this narrative about UGA when no one else has played anyone that well either   Now if we get to the play offs or even the SEC Championship and get smoked well we will know we have not played anyone   But I have this feeling if we play well and win them all  we will hear UGA was gifted this NC   But fuck it  NC am I right

MachineLearning,Depending how  big  this geographical space is  using euclidean space can be problematic since the earth is non euclidean  For example  it would treat 179 degrees east as really far from 179 degrees west  even though they are actually only 2 degrees apart   Could be better to use   https   en wikipedia org wiki Great circle distance

Cooking,Yes however you avoid any contamination from and to your skin    It s easier to wash a plastic glove than your skin due to the concept of how soap works too   It s not over the top  but it s a health measurement    The fact that they are black is because there are different types  blue ones are not as durable
Cooking,Yes I replaced the jamon with the other ingredients  I didn t weigh anything  just tasted the mix  adjusted amounts and seasonings until it tasted nice
CFB,I thought we were speculating wildly on future realignment  As of right now  neither Memphis nor Jackson State is moving  This map has every change that has been announced to this point
science,Does anyone actually think this outside of black supremacist  nation of islam  loonies who also say Beethoven and Shakespear were black
CFB,I believe this is also the situation with Florida  Those closest to Georgia view them as the main rival but the lower you go you get more people who view FSU as the main rival  I grew up in Central Florida  Kissimmee  and I always viewed FSU as the undisputed main rival  It wasn t until I started going to UF did I learn that Georgia was even a rival  I m the only Gators fan in my family as we moved here from PR so no one to tell me to hate UGA and everyone else always said FSU was the big evil
Cooking,I think the only fat I didn t eat was that left over from fresh pork hocks I cook with sauerkraut and dumplings
CFB,Air Force  Rams are reeling and you never want to run into the triple option when you re at thin at LB as we are right now  Our offense has been bad at maximizing possessions this year  so I don t foresee this going well  Calhoun is gonna coach circles around Addazio
politics,I mean  Republicans might be planning this bill as a rug pull  An overwhelming majority support federal legalization on both sides  If Republicans push through the bill successfully  which Democrats likely would support  they get clout from passing the bill instead of the Democrats  It s all about scoring as many points as possible before the mid terms
politics,These ppl must be joking because stories like this can t be real   It s just too ridiculous that some ppl go so far against reality  science and truth
magicTCG,If you click on the link instead of opening them with reddit enhancement suite I explain why I chose each card
cars,So  the legendary DC2 Integra Type R   the best handling FWD car ever   was   FWD  And 0 60 in 6 7 seconds  which isn t far off 7   Amazing how much expectations have changed
CFB,If a 2 seeded Oregon Ohio State Oklahoma cannot beat a 7 seeded Alabama then they are simply not the best team in the country
CFB,I have Oregon state winning  Unless they have some injury I don t know about  they should win  They are a much better team at home
CFB,You new here  Iowa always wins ugly  I m just excited to be 8 2 at this point  Who gives a shit how they got there
science,Everyone says this but never provides a source  Could you point out a study that states sugar from a fruit is less damaging than raw sugar
Cooking,Fry onions and garlic until dark brown and add it to the dish  Will enhance flavours and take away the sweetness
cars,They would be fools to change it  The Challenger design is a home run  Probably the most distinct looking sports muscle car you can buy new under 40k
StockMarket,i didn t say for institutions  read the entire sentence      it usually is retail that sell    look at fund flows for some blackrock funds
politics,It s not really a great one of those  They could ask people polled   In a match up between Biden and a hypothetical Republican nominee  who do you support   It s more of a push poll  where the  step aside  language is intended to make Biden s age salient to respondents before they answer
CFB,We beat USF 41   17 so this showing by Cincy is quite curious   Edit  Lol already downvoted  Stay hard Cincy bros
cars,I m on my 2nd NA Miata  My first one was in terrible condition  My current one is a much more well maintained vehicle
magicTCG,This is amazing  I wish it was an option for the rest of us somehow    I d like us all to have a part of your wonderful token
cars,In many ways this was better than Top Gear episodes    Amazing content  Enjoyed every minute  Love the series
magicTCG,Oh yeah  I ve a friend who s bought like a dozen packs  even splurging on collector boosters  just as a D amp D player with zero interest in MTG as a game  She s even talking me into splitting a booster box with her
science,So they are talking about a change of 50 m per decade in a total height of 10 000 to 17 000 m  So a change of at most 5  in 100 years  Hmmm
CFB,The Big Ten will whittle itself down  Oregon will likely have to beat Utah twice   Oregon State  the Oklahomas might have beat each other twice  Georgia knocks off Alabama in the SEC title game  It s not hard to see the path for Notre Dame
politics,I bet if you wrote a bill that only paid for infrastructure in states that voted for it there would be a lot less votes against things
MachineLearning,Really couldn t care  Corporate real estate investing needs to die  You wonder why housing is so expensive
science,I was part of the April survey  I have also been part of the same survey every two months  So the data is out there even if it hasn t been published yet
travel,So many options  My advice number 1 is safety  That would dictate where I d go  Like there are places in Central America that are fine for tourists but some are very dangerous so do the research   I have friends in Brazil so they take me around and keep me safe  but I d be screwed trying to navigate it alone and not speaking the language
RealEstate,I was looking for just about 11 months  We closed 2 weeks ago and I m still here  I try to lend a hand from my experience  first time seller and second time buyer going from condo  gt single family   Also interested in the various market analysis people drop by with
StockMarket,At current earnings it will take 300 years for your return on investment  I know you said forward looking  but Jesus Christ  did you invent cryogenic freezing or figure out a way to live forever
CFB,Flair bet   I would never  This is just a result of society progressing forward that I am finally free to identify as what I have kept hidden for far too long   that s right   I m a huge Demon Deacon fan   Always have been   always   will be
RealEstate,And once they do reach the appropriate sale value  I expect Black Rock or another corporate investor would be happy to step in  purchase it and turn it into a rental
MachineLearning,It s reassuring to know this is something a lot of people struggle with  Currently my colleagues have lower code standards than I do  which is not intrinsically a bad thing   so yes perhaps I do need to be more selfish and focus on my own use cases  Team culture change can only happen when the team sees the need for it after all
politics,The problem is that the wealthy have too much power in news  lawmaking  and the workplace  They use this to convince citizens to vote in candidates that are on the side of the wealthy and their businesses  Authoritarian societies  which we live in  are willing to sacrifice the health of their bottom classes for the benefit of the upper class
politics,ELI5  This is from the past administration  Current admin tried to stop it  A Trump appointed judge ruled it had to continue
cars,I ve gone 130 in a Hyundai Elantra  fastest car in the world  a rental car with full coverage from my credit card   and a 7 year old Porsche Panamera with piss poor upkeep  The Elantra was down a straight arse American highway  the Panamera was at night  in an actual typhoon with sideways rain  so the speed cameras can t see anything   around sweeping bends on a Taiwanese highway  The Panamera felt way stabler and safer  Chassis design  suspension design and weight makes a huge difference
RealEstate,If the Wharf and National Harbor  not even technically DC  are the only parts of DC that you like then yeah i can see why you aren t fond of DC  Those are both very newly built generic places  let me guess your favorite place in Atlanta is Ponce City Market  Either way  different strokes for different folks
RealEstate,gt Utterly worthless metric  Additionally  Opendoor and the like would be included on this  even though they re not going to hold onto the houses  They re just going to churn it    If iBuyers bought every house available and then sold it  investors would make up 50   of the market  but no more homes would be going to be held by investors than normal  for example
politics,You can be an active voter and point out that a bad candidate is probably going to cause other people to abstain  I would agree with him  Buttigieg as a front runner would depress turnout in the general like it or not as a personal preference
politics,I m an Australian who immigrated to Canada  I m well aware of how fucked and neoliberal the other countries are  but even the right wing in these countries support Universal Healthcare
Cooking,Some friends and I fried up probably 3lbs of Rocky mountain oysters last year and u don t remember them being too chewy  Pretty dang good with a Coors Light
cars,Higher displacement and an extra cylinder could definitely help push even more out of that engine  but I have a feeling the Yaris engine might be a lot stronger than that i4 because one is made for abuse and racing while the other is for SUVs crossovers and vans
RealEstate,California here  Both are correct  You typically get the disclosures in escrow  However  if the house has recently fallen out of escrow or recently had inspections for other reasons  they will share it with serious buyers before they make the offer
politics,And then that violates the NAP  Taking my property is the equivalent of demanding everything and not sharing anything at preschool  That s chaos
politics,So do we need better election integrity or not  It seems like yes  but maybe this is the amount of fraud that sort of happens every election
CFB,Mel needs to call them out but in a positive way  get them out for the closer against PSU  make sure they know the players see these things
CFB,We ll try to help with that Irish bros   I was all behind Cincy running the table and making the CFP up until our fates collided   Now  ideally  ND will make CFP and UH will squeeze into a NY6 bowl
cars,Yeah I really don t get how they can sell 2021 cars that look like they came out of 2010  Way too smooth and bubbly for a new car imo
CFB,But if the other team asked first then he doesn t have to ask the visiting team permission  right  Plus I d imagine you could wear maize versus blue anyways
cars,When I had my Saab I didn t get any kind of wave but there was one guy we both pointed to each other and started bouncing up and down excitedly that we had the same Saab  His girlfriend was so confused and not amused in the slightest
cars,Yeah  the engine is the easiest part of the build  from a certain point of view  It s just a part   Including the cost of a donor car in condition worth spending the money on  guessing 10k right now including hardtop   I d peg  Doing this right  at 100k as a safe budget
politics,Republicans were and are rats led by the Pied Piper  They deserve every bit of the shredding they re going to receive in the history books
StockMarket,You should never follow investment advice from an online forum  so you re doing pretty good on that field  I only read this subreddit in order to get new names to check out  It s like a source of new leads  Active investing it s not meant for everybody and that s okay too  But it s a one way road once you start you can never go back to leave into the hands of an agent
CFB,The first time that Florida played state when he was there they put stuff like this all over the houses in downtown Starkville
politics,biden won t win 2024 no matter the other candidate imo  his primary win was all about  only i can beat trump  and the general win was based on  not trump  votes  it won t work a second time with 4 years for people to move on
cars,I don t think he intends to use this in FD  It ll probably be just a fun car like the 4586 he built    Besides  I don t think FD needs a cost cap  Letting people go wild keeps the field fun and diverse  Also  Unlike other motorsports  more money does not really mean better performance  It s much more reliant on driver skills  Just look at the twin supercharged 599 GTB  easily one of the most expensive cars in FD  at 26th place in the current rankings
politics,gt A do nothing rich guy who s never done a hard days work in his life suddenly trying to rally the troops to turn on their own nation   Seems to be working for him so far  The key is he has them convinced that they re targeting the real enemies  Convince his base that the generals are all part of the  deep state  and they ll beg him to do it
magicTCG,No  But both these cards go very well with   gem hide sliver   or   Manaweft sliver   to get 3 manga for one sliver    Then you only need the   sliver queen   of course
politics,I totally agree    But it s not because of policy   those same  W VA  https   W VA  residents would benefit a GREAT deal if progressives got their way   Manchin is benefiting from nothing but identity politics
cars,Why in the fuck would you want this   People bough this car because it was all they could afford  not because they wanted a Geo Metro
cars,I somehow made it to 300k miles in my 1994 dodge caravan  Shit was getting spooky to drive there towards the end tho lol
magicTCG,did you enjoy doing the detailing on her dress  i m always been in awe of visual artists who are able to have  so much patience  for drawing thing like elaborate detail
cars,You ve got three generations to deal with  If it s just power  I d say you would want to shoot for an S197  2004 2014   although the S550 s  2005 present  are imo way better and more powerful  I had a 2004 and although it was fun  it was nothing like more modern GT s
politics,I don t really care about some dude who died in the middle east over 2000 years ago   People need to move past these old rituals and superstitions if our species is to have a future
science,Isn t it just heuristics  That s not really calculating so much as it is having practiced something so many times you know what to do
CFB,It s been great to see his rebuild working  Takes time when a team has been down for so many years but fantastic progress already and getting back into a bowl is massive and I m sure they ll just keep getting better
politics,gt  As it was  Mitch McConnell  Susan Collins  etc etc got re elected after showing us who they are  Republicans actually GAINED seats in Congress     Rigged voting machines  ES amp S  not Dominion

science,Yep  my dad has HPV induced throat cancer  We thought he beat it several years ago but we just found out it came back last week   EVERYONE should get the HPV vaccine
CFB,It s been 10 years to the day since possibly   the best punt return   the worst tackling in history   FTFY
science,I knew it  all those negative studies and research are just propaganda for society to stop consuming  But if I exercise frequently and am very active I don t think it affects you as bad as they say
CFB,lol I wish  I wanted to but I couldn t convince myself to spend    1k for a weekend of transport lodging tickets  SLC is really nice though   I have booked tickets to Vegas for the Pac 12 championship so  hopefully  see you there
cars,I lot of women do like small trucks  When my brother met his wife at first  she drove around in a bright blue tiny old taco with Toyota written across the tailgate   She had to get rid of it at some point because it rusted out sadly
politics,Because CA has a pipeline that runs across Canada  in fact they have multiple   The US just cancelled their keystone project  which was supposed to be this  Less transportation time  less cost  Simple
magicTCG,Mine is supposed to be transferred from ups to USPS for final delivery  Hasn t got here yet since I got the email and it hasn t updated at all either
politics,Shit   I really wish I was a senator for I would have honestly asked why do we have to vote to censure that racist dude and since the Q publicans are cool with it I will proceed to post vile and untrue stuff about them on tweeter and call their attention to it in real time and watch them squirm   bet turtle man won t like to have a modified pic of him having some nice time with Dump and a bunch of men
cars,Fyi the Regal sedan is actually a hatchback also  So even though it may not look it at first glance I consider them equally quirky to the wagon
politics,The GQP here in Michigan removed Governor s ability to implement her plan and then replaced it with nothing   Quality work done by those asshats
CFB,I m just curious  who has the top SOS now since Arkansas had it for awhile  I would probably guess Indiana off the top of my head
Cooking,Unfortunately you re wrong about the boiling temperature  Adam Ragusea covered this thoroughly   https   youtu be QW7r2RHt6tY
RealEstate,The purchase contract doesn t have a range  The listing agreement tells the agent to listing g with a range of prices  The idea is that a buyer looking below  500 would see this listing
politics,Number 1 but unironically  The average student loan debt is less than the purchase price of a new car    40k    and almost half of all the debt is held by graduate degree holders    People with 100k in loans are doctors lawyers or people who didn t think about their spending whatsoever as they made their way through school  Pay it back       Ä
cars,I have a life dream of one day putting a 500 horsepower battery in a Metro  the ultimate dumb sleeper
politics,I always love the bit that G K  Chesterton said about patriotism    No true patriot ever said  My country  right or wrong   It would be like saying  My mother  drunk or sober     This is an excerpt from a longer diatribe  but it boils down If you re going to truly love a country enough to dedicate yourself to it  you need to acknowledge it s flaws and do whatever you can within your power to address them  While he was talking about countries  I believe the same can be said in this case
StockMarket,Yes  that s where the risks lie  but some industries  energy renewables and robotics  are less riskier than others  so might consider that
videogames,I have to ask  what makes you say the variety of games is great  I only ask because I only see two types of games here with not much variety between them  They are very similar IMO
